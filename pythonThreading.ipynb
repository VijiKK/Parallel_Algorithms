        "Python's threading module provides a way to create and manage threads, allowing you to perform concurrent execution of tasks. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), threads are more suitable for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks. This means that threads in Python are effective for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources like I/O operations, but they might not fully utilize multiple cores for compute-intensive tasks.\n",
